name: init-architecture
description: Initializes or refreshes repository architecture documentation by analyzing the codebase and recommending a reference profile. Use when the user asks to initialize the project, initialize architecture, bootstrap governance, set up layer rules, or when docs/ARCHITECTURE.md is missing, empty, or still the generic template without project-specific facts.

# Skill: Initialize Architecture

Establish **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** as the canonical architecture document for the forked project.
The user must confirm the choice before any write.

## Triggers

- User says: initialize project, init architecture, bootstrap repo, set up layers, define
  architecture, architecture missing.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` does not exist, is empty, or is clearly the uncustomized template.
- Legacy root `ARCHITECTURE.md` on a fork — offer migration to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` only.

## Hard rules

- **Read-only analysis first.** Do not write until the user picks an option.
- **One canonical file:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Never recreate root `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Do not edit application source unless the user explicitly asks to scaffold directories after
  approval.

## Phase 1 — Discover (read-only)

Collect evidence and record a **Repository signals** summary.

### Manifest and toolchain

Detect: language/runtime manifest at the repo root, data-pipeline manifests, ML/notebook trees,
infrastructure trees, application source layout.

### Layout heuristics

| Signal category | Suggests profile |
| --- | --- |
| Source tree organized by horizontal tiers (entry/services/data) | `tiered-service` |
| Data-pipeline manifests, transform/staging/marts trees | `data-engineering` |
| Notebook trees, training/eval directories, ML registries | `data-science` |
| Multiple strong signals at separate roots | `polyglot-monorepo` |
| Config / docs / governance only, no source | `minimal-tooling` |

Each profile lives in its own folder under `.ai/references/architectures/<id>/` and ships:

- `architecture.md` — layer laws, rules, reviewer checklist.
- `blueprint-template.md` — module/package blueprint scaffold for that profile (absent for
  `minimal-tooling`, which has no source tree).

Read both when picking a profile.

### Existing docs

Read: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/*`, ADR titles, blueprints, `.ai/`, `Makefile`.

### Git and CI

- `[ -d .git ]` — required for Phase 5 pipeline bootstrap.
- Detect CI host from repo conventions (workflow directory or pipeline file at the root).
- Default branch: `main` or `master` from `git symbolic-ref` / remote HEAD.
- Existing `make finalize-spec` or workflow named `finalize-spec` — patch only, do not duplicate.

## Phase 2 — Recommend

Present **three options**:

| Option | When |
| --- | --- |
| **A — Adopt reference** `<id>` | Signals match one profile best |
| **B — Keep and refine existing** | Non-empty project-specific architecture already |
| **C — Define new** | Greenfield, unique stack, or blend |

For **A**, rank top 1–3 references with confidence (high / medium / low) and why.

## Phase 3 — Compose (after user approval)

Write `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with: purpose, `primary_domain`, agent protocol, **real** directory
map, layer laws from chosen reference (paths adapted), testing/Makefile section, artifact taxonomy,
**Initialization record** (date, option, reference id).

Create or update `docs/architecture/<domain>.md` when mixed workloads need domain statutes.

Start from `.ai/references/architecture-template.md` for option **C**.

### Seed `docs/blueprints/module-template.md`

Copy `.ai/references/architectures/<chosen-id>/blueprint-template.md` to
`docs/blueprints/module-template.md` so future module blueprints start from the layer map of the
chosen profile. Rules:

- Overwrite any existing `docs/blueprints/module-template.md` only if the user approved option A
  or C (they explicitly chose a profile). For option B, leave the existing template alone unless
  the user asks to refresh it.
- For `minimal-tooling`, skip — no blueprint template ships with that profile.
- For `polyglot-monorepo`, the copied template covers the per-package shape; record in the
  Initialization record which per-domain templates packages should also reference.

New ADRs use `docs/adr/<epoch>-<slug>.md` with heading `# ADR-<epoch>: <title>` (`date +%s` for
epoch). See `docs/adr/README.md`.

## Phase 4 — Post-write

Remind the user to run `make init all`. Suggest module blueprints under `docs/blueprints/`.

Record in **Initialization record** whether Phase 5 ran, was skipped, or CI already had finalize.

### Populate Makefile project targets

The template ships placeholder `install`, `run`, and `test` targets in the root `Makefile`.
Replace those placeholder bodies with real recipes derived from the detected manifest and
chosen reference profile. Examples of what to emit:

| Stack signal | `install` | `run` | `test` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `package.json` | `npm ci` (or `pnpm i` / `yarn`) | `npm run dev` (or detected script) | `npm test` |
| `pyproject.toml` (uv) | `uv sync` | `uv run <entry>` | `uv run pytest` |
| `pyproject.toml` (poetry) | `poetry install` | `poetry run <entry>` | `poetry run pytest` |
| `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `python -m <pkg>` | `pytest` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo fetch` | `cargo run` | `cargo test` |
| `go.mod` | `go mod download` | `go run ./...` | `go test ./...` |
| Data-engineering (dbt) | `uv sync && dbt deps` | `dbt run` | `dbt test` |
| Polyglot monorepo | aggregate per-stack commands or delegate to a workspace tool | same | same |

Rules:

- **Preserve the governance targets** (`init`, `update`, `finalize-spec`) and their comments
  exactly — only edit the bodies of `install`, `run`, `test`.
- **Update the help text** for `install`/`run`/`test` to reflect the real commands.
- **Keep the .PHONY line** intact.
- If a target genuinely does not apply (e.g. `run` for a pure library), keep the target but
  print a one-line explanation instead of removing it.
- For polyglot monorepos, prefer a thin dispatcher (`$(MAKE) -C services/api install`, etc.)
  over inlining every sub-stack's commands.

Record the chosen recipes in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` under **Execution & Developer Experience**
so the source of truth lives next to the architecture decision.

## Phase 5 — Post-merge finalize CI (git repos only)

Run only after Phase 3 user approval (same write gate). **Skip entirely** if `[ ! -d .git ]` — log
`skipped CI bootstrap (not a git repository)` and do not create or edit pipeline files.

`make finalize-spec` is **post-merge cleanup** only (in-flight removal, `status: implemented`,
commit/push). Do not wire gates, PR creation, or ship semantics into this job.

### Detect host and emit

| CI host signal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow directory present (e.g. `.github/workflows/`) | Add a finalize-spec workflow next to existing workflows |
| Root pipeline file present (e.g. `.gitlab-ci.yml`) | Append a finalize-spec job/stage to the existing pipeline |
| `.git` only | Default to the host implied by `origin`; otherwise pick a sensible default and note it in the Initialization record |

Reference templates under `.ai/references/ci/` provide concrete starting points for common CI
hosts; copy and adapt the closest match.

### Idempotency

If any workflow/job already runs `make finalize-spec` or is named `finalize-spec`, do not add a
duplicate — note the existing path in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Create or patch

- **No CI file:** copy from the closest reference under `.ai/references/ci/` (adapt default branch
  name; include git `user.name` / `user.email` in CI before commit).
- **Existing CI:** append the finalize job/stage; do not remove unrelated jobs.

### Document

In `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` **Execution & Developer Experience**, note:

- Post-merge: `make finalize-spec` or CI workflow path.
- Makefile gates (`lint`, `test-unit`, …) belong in a **separate** workflow, not finalize-spec.

### Hard rules (Phase 5)

- Never create CI without `.git`.
- Never trigger finalize on PR open — merged PR / default branch only.
- Never overwrite a full custom pipeline.

## Refusal

- Refuse to overwrite substantial custom `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` without confirmation.
- Refuse to invent directory paths that do not exist unless the user approves scaffolding.
