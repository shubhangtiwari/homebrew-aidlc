# Skill: Classify Change (triage)

Portable playbook for **tier triage** on governed work. Authority for routing after triage lives in
`.ai/README.md` (Hard Rule 7). This skill does **not** grant permission to edit governed source.

## When to run

- **Main session** is about to touch **governed paths** (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/blueprints/`,
  `docs/spec/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/`) via `implementer` or
  needs a spec — **before** inline intent, spec drafting, or implementer.
- **Skip** for configuration-only work (`.ai/`, IDE config, `Makefile` when not a contract),
  exploration, or Q&A with no implementation.

## Who runs it

The **main session** follows this playbook directly (read `docs/spec/README.md` and relevant
blueprints; post the Triage record in chat). **Do not** delegate triage to `architect`.

Triage is **read-only** with respect to governed trees: no spec file, no ADR, no blueprint edits, no
`src/` or `tests/` changes.

When triage yields **`next: draft-spec`** (tier medium, large, or uncertain), the main session
**must** delegate **`architect`** for planning (spec + approval brief) — do not draft the spec in the
main session.

## Prerequisites (main session)

1. Restate the user's problem statement in one sentence.
2. Read `docs/spec/README.md` (tier definitions).
3. Skim relevant `docs/blueprints/` modules if the request names an area (router, API, graph,
   integrations).
4. If architecture is initialized, skim `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the domain profile under
   `docs/architecture/` when layer boundaries matter.
5. Resolve the AIDLC owning scope for named or likely affected paths: start at each path's directory,
   walk upward to the invocation root, and select the nearest directory containing both
   `.ai/README.md` and `docs/spec/README.md`. If none is found below the invocation root, use the
   invocation root.

## Classification rules

Apply `docs/spec/README.md` literally. Tier by semantic and coordination risk. File count, line
count, and directory spread are evidence to inspect; they are not automatic gates by themselves.
In particular:

| Tier | Typical signals |
| --- | --- |
| **Trivial** | Typo, rename, comment, or obvious one-line fix; no behavior, contract, state, integration, or topology change |
| **Small** | Low-risk localized fix, single test, dependency bump, bounded helper use, or mechanical multi-file edit; no public behavior/schema change, module contract change, owned-state change, integration boundary change, or topology change |
| **Medium** | Public behavior change, schema/contract change, target-state semantics change, workflow or graph topology change, integration boundary change, or coordination across modules that needs a plan |
| **Large** | Cross-cutting architectural change, many coordinated modules, new external integration, durable state migration, ADR-level decision, or high rollback/user-impact risk |
| **Uncertain** | Scope or tier unclear after reading docs; would change path if wrong |

Multi-file work can remain **small** when each touched file is part of the same bounded, low-risk
change and the blueprint-owned concerns above do not move. A one-file change can still be
**medium** or **large** when it changes public behavior, schemas, contracts, target state,
integrations, or workflow topology. When **any** medium trigger might apply, prefer **medium** or
**uncertain** over small. Do not down-tier to avoid a spec.

## Method

1. List concrete triggers you checked (files/areas, file/line count signals, blueprint concerns,
   public behavior, state, graph/topology, integrations, and coordination cost).
2. Assign **one** tier: `trivial` | `small` | `medium` | `large` | `uncertain`.
3. Set **`next`**:
   - `inline-intent` — trivial or small → main posts intent → user confirms → `implementer`.
   - `draft-spec` — medium, large, or uncertain → **delegate `architect`** for spec + approval brief.
   - `ask-user` — one or two focused questions whose answers would change tier or `next`.
4. Write a **rationale** (2–4 sentences), plain language.
5. Include the resolved owning scope(s) in `suggested_scope` when path evidence is available. If a
   medium/large/uncertain request spans multiple scopes, note that architect must draft one spec per
   scope.
6. Post the **Triage record** (format below) in chat, then **route immediately** per `next` (do not
   skip architect delegation when `next` is `draft-spec`).

## Triage record (required output)

Use exact field names:

```markdown
## Triage record

- **tier:** trivial | small | medium | large | uncertain
- **next:** inline-intent | draft-spec | ask-user
- **rationale:** …
- **triggers_checked:** …
- **suggested_scope:** files or modules (optional, best effort)
```

## After triage (main session)

| `next` | Main session action |
| --- | --- |
| `inline-intent` | Post short inline intent from triage; user confirms; delegate `implementer` only. **No** `reviewer` unless user asks. |
| `draft-spec` | **Delegate `architect`** with the Triage record and problem statement. Architect writes spec + approval brief. **Do not** call `implementer` until spec is approved. |
| `ask-user` | Ask the questions; re-run this skill after answers. |

Do not override `tier` or `next` without user consent in chat.

## Out of scope (this skill)

- Writing or updating `<scope-root>/docs/spec/*.md` in the main session (architect planning only).
- Running `implementer` or `reviewer` before triage and routing complete.
- Tiering for non-governed paths (main session may proceed without this skill).

## Outcome

- A **Triage record** exists in chat before any governed implementation step.
- Trivial/small → inline intent → implementer.
- Medium/large/uncertain → **architect** (automatic) → spec → approve → implementer → reviewer.
